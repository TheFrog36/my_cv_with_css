        <h1><b>Rediscovering the world</b></h1>
        <p>
          I alwasy loved making photos, since when I got my first camera at the age of 8. Initially I didn't see the real potential in it though. 
          I thought photography was about posing people, catching sunsets and beautiful landscapes.
          But then i discovered macro photography, and a whole new world opened in front of me. At that point it became a game, an exploration.
          Looking for lines, interesting propectives, weird subjects and creating the abstract from the concrete.
          You can see all this in my latest and favorite project. 
        </p>

        <h2>Origami project</h2>
        <p>with this work my main purpose was to valorise the process of creation. 
            Usually when poeple see an origami, they only see the final
            product and can enjoy only the end result. But, as someone that crafts them, 
            I wanted to share the hidden beauty that most people 
            never see, the beauty of making them. How, with some patience and precision, a single square sheet of paper can create the most 
            complicated creature.
